On January 15, Triple C (Chinese Computer Community) had a 'Winter 2019 General Body Meeting' with our incoming staff and our new project contributors. We had 30 students coming for joining our group. By here, we introduced our origination's culture and goals, recruiting talented new staff, showed two of our Website Projects proudly completed by the end of last quarter. We all had a delightful night and finally found where our dream is at together. For further inquiries or if you intend to join our organization, feel free to contact with us via Triple C official email: ucsdtriplec@gmail.com.
