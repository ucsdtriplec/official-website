### Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the future performance of major indices in the U.S. stock market using existing news headlines from previous days.

### Structure
This project mainly requires two parts of data: 1 Historical data of indices, e.g. S&P500, will be our target of prediction. 2 News headlines, i.e. English text data that relates to the stock market. For the robustness of our prediction model, we preferably need data that covers a long time period, i.e. including both bear markets and bull markets.
