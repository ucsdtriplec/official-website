## Introduction
The official website is designed to help people who are interested in Triple C to get to know us better.  We used a clear and simple UI design to make sure the viewers can easily find the information they are looking for. The website allows others who are unfamiliar with Triple C to know more details about what we do. The official website contains information about our founding history and projects that students did in the past. We also have our weekly newsletter and future events detail on the website so students can easily access the latest information.
